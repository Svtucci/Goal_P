        <p>Drinking water is one if not THE most important thing you can do to stay healthy, however it seems that in our busy lives it always takes a backseat. I think a good way to fix this is a way to track how much water you drink everyday, and even set a goal to achieve! That is why I created Goal_P (Gulp). Goal_P is a no nonsense hydration tracker. You set your goal for the next 30 days, add your water consumption throughout the day, log it, and look at your progress. Thatâ€™s it. 
Other trackers may show too much information and overwhelm the user, this is a simple app where you submit your cups and move on with your busy life. </p>
